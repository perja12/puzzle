# Puzzle/hunt game

This repo contains some code to make a very simple puzzle/hunt game that can be used for f.ex. Easter egg hunt. To start the hunt the participants gets a URL (to this web page) and an initial code that will use on that page. This againt unlocks the next hint - f.ex. some place nearby which contains a new code that they will enter. And this goes on and on until the Easter egg has been found.


## Setup instructions
